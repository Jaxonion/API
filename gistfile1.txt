For me the client is like the Walmart. Walmart is the gateway between the consumer and the product. The product manufacturers are like the server. They have what's wanted. Do to demands of the consumer, Walmart will request the product that's wanted. The product will be sent and displayed/sold to the costumer. In this scenerio the truck drivers who deliver the product are like the Internet Service provider which delevers the request to the right address and also delevers the needed item(s) back to the store for the consumer.
